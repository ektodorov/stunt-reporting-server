Stunt reporting is a tool mainly for developer during the development cycle of an application. We can have logs during the execution of our application on an Android device and iOS device. It can be of help for distributed teams when there are different devices available in different geographical locations of the team. We can leave the logging enabled during production as well and use Stunt as analytics, the same way of remote logging or both.
Stunt server is the server application that provides the services collecting the data and the user portal where the collected data can be viewed.
