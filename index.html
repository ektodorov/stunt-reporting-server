<p>What is Stunt ?</p>
</div>
Stunt reporting is a tool mainly for developers during the development cycle of an application. We can have logs during the execution of our application on an Android device and iOS device, or from any other device where our application is used - for example we can have our AJAX application use Stunt. It can be of help for distributed teams when there are different devices available in different geographical locations of the team. We can leave the logging enabled during production as well and use Stunt as analytics, the same way for remote logging or other analytics we want to collect of how clients users use the application. 
Stunt-Reporting is the client part for Android that provides the connection to the services of Stunt-Server to collect the data and which would be available through the user portal where the collected data can be viewed. 
Stunt server is the server application that provides the services collecting the data and the user portal where the collected data can be viewed.
